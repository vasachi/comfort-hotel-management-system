Welcome to my Hotel Resrvation System repository

This management system is tailored for use in a hotel setting, primarily developped to keep track of the hotel reservation and allocate hotel rooms to the guests. This system is built using PHP and SQL for the database and HTML and CSS for the web forms and web interface. The project features a website dedicated for the hotel in which external users can use to link to the reservation form to make reservations.

Feel free to browse through the files to gain an understanding of the system design and style. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a similar project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
